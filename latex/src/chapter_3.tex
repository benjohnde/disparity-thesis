\label{chap:related}

In this chapter the related work regarding disparity algorithms is treated.
As integration of some disparity algorithms for the later evaluation was part of this thesis, the ones which were actually implemented are examined in more detail.
The well-known semi-global matcher by \citeauthor{hirschmuller2005accurate} is introduced and the OpenCV implementations are mentioned.
An approach by \citeauthor{Geiger2010ACCV} to enable fast matching of high-resolution images is discussed.
Both approaches utilize local methods for estimating disparity maps.
One candidate adopting global methods is the Middlebury MRF library, which is also introduced in this chapter.
This implies solving optimization problems (i.e. the minimization of a global energy cost function).
Thus, the methods implemented by the library to solve such optimization problems are outlined.
In the end, a short outlook on spatiotemporal consistency regarding disparity algorithms applied on videos is presented.

\section{Semi-global matching}

\citeauthor{hirschmuller2005accurate} combines two different methods, global- and local-matching for determining accurate disparity at a lower runtime as other global algorithms, which tend to run pretty long on current hardware \citep{hirschmuller2005accurate, hirschmuller2008stereo}.
\newline\newline\noindent The semi-global matching (SGM) method utilizes pixel-wise matching of so called mutual information (MI) via entropy $H$, their joint-entropy of a pair of images and combining those with the approximation of a global two-dimensional smoothness constraint:

\begin{equation}
  MI_{I_1,I_2} = H_{I_1} + H_{I_2} + H_{I_1,I_2}.
\end{equation}

\noindent The previous discussed one-dimensional constraints are applied as well.
Calculating the matching cost based on mutual information is insensitive to recording differences and illumination changes \citep{hirschmuller2005accurate, viola1997alignment}.
The joint entropy $H_{I_1,I_2}$ is low (meaning low information content) for rectified images as one image can be predicted by the other.
The MI matching cost are defined as the following:

\begin{equation}
  mi_{I_1,I_2}(i,k) = h_{I_1}(i) + h_{I_2}(k) - h_{I_1,I_2}(i,k),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are calculated from the probability distribution of corresponding intensities.
Thus, $h_{I_1,I_2}(i,k)$ serves as the matching cost for the two intensities $i$ and $k$.
The idea then is, that one image needs to be warped\footnote{In this context warping can be seen as a function which maps pixels from the destination image to pixels in the original image. Then the pixels are copied at the mapped position to the coordinates in the destination image.} such that corresponding pixels are at the same location in both stereo images:

\begin{equation}
    I_1 = I_b\quad \textrm{and}\quad I_2 = f_D(I_m),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $I_b$ is the base image, $I_m$ the match image and $f_D(x)$ is a function which outputs the matching corresponding point.
As the matching cost represent the information content of two intensities $I_1$ and $I_2$, which should be low (i.e. as equal as possible), the disparity map $D$ needs to be known \textit{a priori} for warping.
Hence, the MI matching cost needs to be calculated either iteratively or hierarchically.
On the one hand, an iteratively approach utilizes a random disparity image for calculating the MI matching cost, which serves as the base for the next iterations.
On the other hand, the MI matching cost can be calculated hierarchically by recursively using an up-scaled disparity image, which has been calculated at half resolution with a common similarity measurement like SAD.
For a deeper explanation of how the mutual information are exactly calculated and used in the SGM method compare \citep{hirschmuller2005accurate, hirschmuller2007evaluation, hirschmuller2008stereo, hirschmuller2011semi}.

\subsection*{OpenCV BM and SGBM}

The OpenCV library \citep{opencv_library} offers with its current version 3.1.0 two implementations for disparity estimation, block matching and semi-global block matching based on the idea of \citeauthor{hirschmuller2005accurate}.
This version also contains a new filter, which was initially introduced with version 3.0.0, named \textit{Disparity WLS Filter}\footnote{\url{http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d9/d51/classcv_1_1ximgproc_1_1DisparityWLSFilter.html}}.
WLS stands for weighted least squares (in the form of a fast global smoother).
This disparity filter smoothes the disparity and also performs a left-right-consistency check to refine the results in especially half-occluded and uniform areas \citep{min2014fast}.
This yields to better and more accurate results but has the drawback of loosing negative disparity values.
Negative disparity can appear if the stereo cameras are verged or inclined towards each other.
The WLS filtering results in disparity ranging from $0$ to $D_{max}$, as set before.
Thus the negative disparity is $-1$.

\section{ELAS: Efficient large-scale stereo matching}

\citeauthor{Geiger2010ACCV} proposed a novel approach for estimating the disparity with so called support points \citep{Geiger2010ACCV, Geiger2011IV}.
A support point is like a feature, a point which can be robustly matched.
For those support points a sparse disparity map is calculated.
For more robustness, only the support points which can be matched left-to-right and right-to-left are retained.
To remove ambiguities, the ratio between the best and the second best match of all points is taken into account.
If the ratio exceeds a fixed threshold, the points are removed.
Support points which have a different disparity value than all adjacent points are outliers and removed as well.
As the found support points may not cover the whole image, additional support points in the image corners are added.
They adopt the disparity value of their nearest neighbor.
Then, image coordinates of the remaining support points are used to create a 2D mesh via Delaunay triangulation.
To obtain a dense disparity map missing disparities are interpolated using mesh of the Delaunay triangulation by using the nearest-neighbor on the same image line.
For more information how the support points get calculated and how the interpolation is done exactly, compare \citep{Geiger2010ACCV, Geiger2011IV}.

\section{Middlebury MRF library}

The Middlebury MRF library \citep{scharstein2014high, szeliski2008comparative} utilizes a global energy function consisting of Markov random fields to formulate an energy minimization problem and offers the following methods to solve this optimization problem:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item iterated conditional modes (ICM),
  \item graph cuts expansion approach (cf. \citep{boykov2001fast, ramin2004energy, kolmogorov2004energy}),
  \item graph cuts swap approach (cf. \citep{boykov2001fast, ramin2004energy, kolmogorov2004energy}),
  \item sequential tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRWS)\\(cf. \citep{kolmogorov2006convergent, wainwright2005map}),
  \item sequential belief propagation (BPS) (cf. \citep{boykov2001fast}),
  \item max-product belief propagation (BPM) (cf. \citep{boykov2001fast}).
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The following subsections give a rough overview on some of those methods.
Additionally, a short introduction into MRF-based energy functions is given.
Also, the generalized concepts of how the above techniques help to solve such optimization problems are outlined.

\subsection{Solving optimization problems}

Many problems in computer vision can be described in terms of energy minimization for instance image smoothing, the stereo correspondence problems as described in Chapter \ref{chap:foundations} and many other.
Thus, solving of optimization problems is a key part in modern stereo matcher algorithms.
They solve the labelling problem as described in Chapter \ref{chap:foundations}.
Most of the current disparity algorithms are using global methods to solve an energy minimization problem.
Usually they utilize Markov random fields (MRF) based energy functions.
As such MRF based energy functions are \textit{NP-hard} approximation algorithms like the following are typically used \citep{tappen2003comparison, cyganek2011introduction}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item dynamic programming,
  \item belief propagation,
  \item graph cuts.
\end{itemize}

\noindent All of these methods have in common that they are supposed to solve so called inference problems, or at least approximate those.
Markov random fields, mentioned before, is also called Markov network.
Bayesian networks as well as Markov networks are so called graphical models.
Such graphical models help to understand the reasoning behind those formulations and to actually build algorithms which solve those inference problems.
Both networks express the dependencies of nodes as the conditional probability.
A chain of nodes is the so called joint probability.
This is then the product over-all (joint) probabilities.
The goal of algorithms which solve inference problem is to compute certain marginal probabilities, i.e. the probability that some pixel reaches a specific label node \citep{cyganek2011introduction}.
With inference the computation of these marginal probabilities is meant.
Marginal probabilities are defined as the sums over all possible state of all the other nodes in the system.
They are also called beliefs \citep{yedidia2003understanding}.

\subsubsection{Markov random fields}

Markov random fields (MRF), also called Markov network, are used to formulate problems in a probabilistic way represented as an undirected graph consisting of random variables, see \ref{fig:markov}.
A MRF is a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $V = {1,2,...N}$ denotes a set of vertices or nodes.
Each node is associated with a random variable $u_j$ for $j = 1...N$.
$E$ describes the edges $(i,j) \in E$ between the nodes $i$ and $j$.
The neighborhood of a node $i$ is the set of nodes to which the node $i$ is adjacent, i.e. $j \in N$ if and only if $(i,j) \in E$.
The neighborhood of a node $i$ is denoted as $N_i$.
For a simple undirected graph compare Figure \ref{fig:simple-graph}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    [scale=1.0,auto=left,every node/.style={circle,fill=blue!20}]
    \node (nA) at (5,9)  {A};
    \node (nB) at (8,9)  {B};
    \node (nC) at (10,7.5) {C};
    \node (nD) at (8,6)  {D};
    \node (nE) at (5,6)  {E};
  
    \foreach \from/\to in {nA/nE,nA/nB,nB/nC,nC/nD,nD/nB,nD/nE}
      \draw (\from) -- (\to);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption[Simple undirected unweighted graph]{Simple undirected unweighted graph}
  \label{fig:simple-graph}
\end{figure}

\noindent The Markov random field satisfies:

\begin{equation}
  P(u_i\ |\ \{u_j\}_{j \in V\\N}) = P(u_i\ |\ \{u_j\}_{j \in N_i}),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N_i$ is the so called Markov blanket of node $i$.
It describes that the graph should be conditionally independent of all of the other variables given its neighbors.
A hop from one node to another can be seen as a chain of probabilities which have to occur, also called Markov chain.
The main idea behind MRF in combination with computer vision problems is to formulate the so called labelling problem in such a way, that each pixel has a likelihood to belong to a certain label \citep{tamassia2013handbook}.
The core problem then is to find exactly one label for each pixel, represented as a node in a MRF.
This label represents then the optimal solution to an underlying problem, in the case of stereo correspondence, the disparity for a pixel \citep{cyganek2011introduction}.
\newline\newline\noindent In contrast to MRF there also exist Bayesian networks.
A Bayesian network is a directed graph there as MRF is undirected.
This implies two important aspects, the direction of a certain probability to hop from one node to another.
MRF can not represent induced and non-transitive dependencies.
Two independent random variables may be connected by an edge because of possible dependencies.
Bayesian networks overcome this limitations.
\newline\newline\noindent The underlying stereo model of the Middlebury MRF library is based on the research of \citeauthor{sun2003stereo}.
They model stereo matching by three coupled MRF \citep{sun2003stereo}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $D$ as the smooth disparity field,
  \item $L$ for representing depth-discontinuities,
  \item $O$ is a spatial binary state for handling occlusions.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Figure \ref{fig:mrf-stereo-matching} depicts the relationship between $D$, $L$ and $O$.
The joint probability over $D$, $L$ and $O$ given a pair of stereo images $I = {I_L,I_R}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  P(D,L,O|I) = \frac{P(I|D,L,O)P(D,L,O)}{P(I)}.
\end{equation}
They then approximate inference via belief propagation over this equation.
For a deeper dive into this topic compare \citep{sun2003stereo, tamassia2013handbook, cyganek2011introduction, yedidia2003understanding, boykov2001fast, kolmogorov2006convergent, wainwright2005map}.

  \label{fig:mrf-stereo-matching}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Factor graph}

\noindent As those problems are \textit{NP-hard}, there exist several approximation algorithms which are outlined in the following subsections.
All of these approximation algorithms work on so called factor graphs.
A factor graph represents a factorized function and is bipartite\footnote{If the nodes of a graph can be divided into two disjoint sets, for instance $U$ and $V$, such that every edge connects a node $U$ to one in $V$, then the graph is bipartite.}.
A MRF function is factorized in partial functions and then formulated in a factor graph.
The solution to the problem represented by the factor graph is then approximated.
An important notion of factor graphs is the message which can be passed from a node to another.
There a few exceptions: for instance if the factor graph contains no cycles, the solution can then be exact computed with message passing algorithms (also called belief propagation) which work on a tree.
Otherwise only an approximation is possible.

\subsubsection{Dynamic programming}

In general, dynamic programming means having an optimization problem which can be parted into smaller chunks.
Then these chunks get solved individually and in the end, these chunks are connected and the optimization problem is minimized \citep{angel1972dynamic, bellman2015applied, cyganek2011introduction}.
For stereo matching this applies to the partition of a two-dimensional search problem into a series of isolated one-dimensional search problems on each pair of epipolar lines.
These problems are then solved independently.
With dynamic programming the following energy function (introduced in the foundations Chapter \ref{chap:foundations} can be solved independently per scanline.

\begin{equation}
  E(d) = E_{data}(d) + \lambda E_{smooth}(d)
\end{equation}

\noindent Dynamic programming has two benefits, it is solvable efficiently in polynomial time and it enforces the ordering constraint (as it is solved per scanline).
But it can lead to streaking effects, meaning that the result image seems to be constructed of many independent layers.

\subsubsection{Belief propagation}

Belief propagation (BP) is in general a technique to perform inference on a probabilistic model like Bayesian networks or Markov random fields \citep{yedidia2003understanding, tappen2003comparison, cyganek2011introduction}.
As mentioned before, \citeauthor{sun2003stereo} presented a stereo model for belief propagation.
BP works with messages which are passed from one node to another.
This is the reason why BP is also known as the message-passing algorithm.
The nodes exchange information about probabilities.
In the case of stereo matching, the message contains the probability that the receiver node (a node in MRF) should hold a disparity which is consistent with all information already passed to it by a sender.
The nodes are partitioned into low- and high-confidence ones.
The messages also carry a property, the entropy.
The entropy is high when sending from low- to high-confidence nodes and vice versa.

\subsubsection{Graph cuts}

For approximating problems formulated in a Markov random field there also exist so called graph cuts algorithms \citep{boykov2001fast, cyganek2011introduction}.
In general, graph cuts work like the following: assuming a graph $G$ with nodes $N$ and some edges $E$.
The goal is to delete enough edges so that each pixel is connected to exactly one label node.
Given a weighted graph $G$ with source $s$ and sink $t$ nodes.
The graph should be partitioned into two sets, $S$ and $T$, where $s \in S$ and $t \in T$.
This set presents a subgraph such that the sum of edge weights spanning this partition is minimized.
\newline\newline\noindent In the case of computer vision graph cuts are inspired by the combinatorial optimization methods for maximum flow \citep{cyganek2011introduction, cormen2009introduction}.
There exist two basic variations of the maximum flow problem, called $\alpha$-$\beta$-swap and $\alpha$-expansion.
Initially, three labels exist, that are $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\lambda$. 
Normally, one step would be to change the label of a pixel, calculate the energy again and then infer if the change was good or not, depending on the delta.
For instance one pixel labelled with $\lambda$ would then be $\beta$.
The $\alpha$-$\beta$-swap algorithm whole areas of $\alpha$ are swapped with $\beta$ with $\lambda$ being unchanged.
In an $\alpha$-expansion a huge number of pixels labelled $\beta$ and $\lambda$ are changed into $\alpha$.
But in each of those methods the outcome is then measured.
In the foundations Chapter \ref{chap:foundations} the following equation was introduced:
\begin{equation}
  D = \arg\min_{d} E(d).
\end{equation}
\noindent If the outcome of such a swap or expansion is better, meaning $E(D_{after}) < E(D_{before})$, the algorithm continues.
If not, the algorithm stops.
Thus, both algorithms are expected to be stopped after the first unsuccessful run (i.e. energy increases).
The difficulty is to find the optimal swap move and the initial seed.
Both is described in \citep{boykov2001fast, sinha2004graph, tappen2003comparison, ramin2004energy}.

\section{Spatiotemporal consistency}

Although stereo correspondence is a research field which has been heavily investigated for a few decades no real disparity algorithm for videos exists yet.
One reason for that can be the lack of solid ground-truth data.
Only a few datasets has been introduced lately \citep{Butler:ECCV:2012, scharstein2014high}.
However, a novel approach was presented by \citep{richardt2010real}, \citep{khoshabeh2011spatio} and \citep{hosni2012temporally}.
\newline\newline\noindent The basic idea behind all of those presented approaches is to handle occurring noise.



Explain how the video restoration algorithms work (basically). They added noise. Blablabla.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Small description what is currently available.
  \item What can we do?
  \item Explain why some stuff is not available at all.
  \item Also point out the lack of ground truth data. This is a huge problem.
  \item Link to datasets!
\end{itemize}

Also outline the following approach: \citep{lee2012local}.
