\section{Future outlook}

A few thoughts on possible future work to improve the presented algorithms, split in low- and high-level from a technical perspective:

\subsection*{Low-level}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Neuronal networks \citep{olshausen1996emergence}
  \item Other matching cost calculation methods \citep{hermann2010gradient}.
  \item Focus more on how humans experience depth? \citep{deangelis1995neuronal}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{High-level}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Real-time availability
  \item higher resolution
  \item What's on the market, like multi-view?
  \item Provide more real-world ground truth disparity maps \citep{kondermann2015stereo, Geiger2011IV}.
\end{itemize}
